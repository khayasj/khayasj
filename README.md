# 👋 Hi, I’m Shin Than Thar Aung!

I'm a tech-focused professional with 6+ years of experience across manufacturing, supply chain coordination, automation systems, and digital operations — now specializing in data analytics, cloud technologies, and user-focused system design.

🔧 I started my career maintaining PLC systems and designing AutoCAD schematics for high-speed milling operations.  
📊 Later, I led full-cycle B2B logistics and sales operations at a large-scale biomass fuel factory, where I reduced raw material waste by 30% and improved delivery coordination.  
🧠 I upskilled through a full Data Analytics Bootcamp (Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI) and earned a Bachelor's in Computer Science (Big Data) from the University of Wollongong.  
🧪 My academic and freelance projects include:

- **🧹 C2C Home Cleaning Platform**  
  Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express, MySQL, Bootstrap, JSON  
  → A customer-to-cleaner matching platform using a full-stack BCE structure with CI/CD via GitHub Actions

- **🫁 COVID-19 X-ray Diagnostic System**  
  Stack: PyTorch, UNet + ResNet34, DenseNet121, FastAPI, Gradio, MongoDB, Tailwind, PHP  
  → A deep learning-powered diagnostic tool with segmentation, classification, and a doctor validation loop using confidence scores

- **🔬 Superconductivity Prediction via Big Data**  
  Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, PySpark, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  → Predictive modeling using big data analysis and distributed computation to explore material behavior

- **📧 Spam Email Detection Filter**  
  Stack: Python, TF-IDF, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Voting Classifier 
  → An NLP-based spam detection system with ensemble learning and dataset drift evaluation

- **🕹️ Gesture-Controlled Game Interface**  
  Stack: MediaPipe, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras  
  → Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam input, applied to gaming and accessibility use cases
